# Guess the Number Game

A simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a set range. This project is a fun way to practice coding fundamentals like loops, conditionals, and basic input/output.

## How to Play

1. The computer generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).
2. The player is prompted to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the game provides feedback:
   - If the guess is too high, it prompts "Too high, try again."
   - If the guess is too low, it prompts "Too low, try again."
4. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
5. The player is informed of how many attempts it took to guess correctly.
